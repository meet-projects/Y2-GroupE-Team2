    <h1> What is Celiac Disease?</h1>
<p> Celiac disease (CeD) is a genetic autoimmune condition that mainly affects the gastrointestinal tract when gluten is ingested. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. When someone with CeD eats gluten, the lining of the small intestine becomes damaged and is unable to absorb nutrients properly.</p>

<h1>Treatment of Celiac Disease</h1>
<p>Currently the only treatment for CeD is the lifelong adherence to a strict gluten-free (GF) diet. All food that either contains gluten or might have had contact with gluten (known as cross-contact) must be avoided.</p>

<h1>People with CeD must watch for cross-contact and/or items that have been used with gluten containing food and cannot be sufficiently cleaned. For example:</h1>

<p>toasters, toaster ovens, air fryers
food preparation surfaces
condiments and spreads
shared serving utensils
colanders/strainers
deep fryers
It can take time to heal, but it is vital to keep to a strict GF diet.</p>

<h1>Who has Celiac Disease?</h1>
<p>CD is common, affecting at least 1% of the population
Upwards of 83% of people with CeD are undiagnosed
The genes known to be associated with CD are HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8
When a first degree family member has CD, the probability of developing it increases significantly
CeD can develop at any age
CeD affects individuals of all ethnicities
Symptoms of Celiac Disease
There are over 200 symptoms of CD and they vary so widely that there is no such thing as a typical case. Many people do not experience any of the gastric symptoms that were previously thought to typify the condition. These individuals often face a delay in diagnosis.</p>
